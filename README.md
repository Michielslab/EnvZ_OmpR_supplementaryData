This folder contains the R scripts, related output (OutputFiles), and imageJ processing code linked to the manuscript: "Reprogramming the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system confers ethanol tolerance in Escherichia coli by stabilizing the outer membrane and altering iron homeostasis".

The indivdual .csv files include the raw OD data as exported from the Cerillo OD595 readers where cells are either exposed to PQ or H202 (3 different biological replicates/condition). These files are imported into the R script: FigS25 - QurvE_EC50_analyzer.qmd.
